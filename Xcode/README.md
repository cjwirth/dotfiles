# Xcode User Data

This directory contains settings and things for Xcode.

Upon a new install of Xcode, the contents of the directory should be copied to `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData`.

I'm not sure how to merge them if you've already customized them.

## Contents

- KeyBindings
	- Key bindings that I've come to use over the years
- xcdebugger
	- User level breakpoints, which are common across all projects and workspaces
